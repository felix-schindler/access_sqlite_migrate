# Getting started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:felix-schindler/access_sqlite_migrate.git
cmake .
make
```

you can also just use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) and do everything from in there.

> Visual Studio for Mac does not support developing C++.
